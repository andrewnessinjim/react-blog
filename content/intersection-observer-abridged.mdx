In this post, I'll explain the concept behind [the browser's native IntersectionObserver API][1] and how to use it.

## Prerequisites

This post assumes familiarity with the following topics:

1. React, particularly the hooks - [useEffect][2] and [useRef][3].
2. Basic understanding of [viewports][4].
3. [Callbacks in JavaScript][5].
4. Basic CSS.

## Visualizing The Concept

I have built an interactive demo below to help me explain the Intersection Observer API. Imagine the web page as the box with a dashed outline and the browser's viewport as the box with a solid outline. Also, imagine viewing the page in the viewport. We need a scrollbar to see how the Intersection Observer works, hence I've made the page longer than the viewport. Use the scrollbar next to the page to scroll the page and see what you can understand. This is just to help you get familiar with the idea before I explain it in detail. üòä

<IntersectionObserverVisualizer
  caption={
    <NoMarginParagraph>
      Click the "Start Observing" button to begin. The ü§® emoji will appear,
      indicating that we're in the observing state. Now, use the slider on the
      right to scroll the page and watch for the üòç emoji to appear at key
      moments. Take note of the exact states when it shows up.

Based on your observation, see if you can answer the quiz below. You don't have to get them right, the important thing is that you make an attempt. This will help you understand the concept better.

The üòç emoji appears at 3 distinct states:

- As soon as we start observing (we won't cover this in this blog post).
- When the balloon first enters the viewport when we're observing.
- When the balloon first exits the viewport when we're observing.

Technically, the balloon in our example is called the _target_ (it's the element we want to observe), and the viewport is called the _root_.

The second state indicates that at least one pixel of the target overlapped with at least one pixel of the root; we say the target _intersects_ with the root. The third state indicates that no pixels of the target overlapped with the root; we say the target _doesn't intersect_ with the root.

Let's look at some code!

## The API

Here's an implementation of the above behaviour in React. Play around by scrolling the page and see if you can figure out what's going on. I'll break down the parts right below the playground. Try scrolling the balloon in and out of view and compare it with the interactive demo above. Clear the console and reload the page to observe the behavior from the beginning.

<SandpackDemo projectSubDir="intersectionObserver/basic" />

We create an Intersection Observer using its constructor:

```js
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback);
```

The `callback` will be invoked by the `observer` when something _interesting_ happens. Our callback simply logs "Interesting". In the interactive demo, this callback invocation was represented by the emoji üòç appearing.

```js
() => {
  console.log("Interesting");
};
```
How does the `observer` know what is interesting? We have two knobs to tell the observer what we are interested in.

### The First Knob: Specifying the target

The first one is to specify the target:

```js
observer.observe(observedElemRef.current); //This is the balloon
```

Now that the `observer` is made aware of the target, it starts observing it. This is represented by the "ü§® Start Observing" button in the interactive demo.

We can make the same three observations from this code as in the interactive demo. The üòç emoji from the demo is replaced with logs in the code example:

- "Interesting" is logged when the page first loads. (This actually happen when we first call the `observe` function on the `observer`. It just appears to happen on page load.)
- It's logged when the first pixel of the target enters the viewport.
- It's also logged when last pixel of the target exits the viewport.

This is the default behaviour of the `IntersectionObserver` when we do not use the second knob.

### The `entries` Argument

Our `callback` is invoked with the `entries` argument by the `observer`. This argument is an array where each item describes the intersection event that caused the `callback` to be invoked. We ignored the event in the previous example. In the following example, we use it to trigger an animation when the target enters the viewport.

<SandpackDemo projectSubDir="intersectionObserver/scaleOnEntry" />

Let's look at the `entries` argument:

```js
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  const [entry] = entries;
  setIsBalloonVisible(entry.isIntersecting);
});
```

We pluck the one and only item from the `entries` array. How do we know it has only one element? Because we have _observed_ only one element. (When we observe multiple elements or tweak the second knob in certain ways, the `entries` argument can have multiple events. We won't cover that in this blog post.)

Each intersection event comes with a set of properties. For instance, the `isIntersecting` property tells us whether the target has intersected with the root at the moment the event occurred. We use this to conditionally apply the `scaleUp` CSS class whenever the target (in this case, the balloon) becomes visible. This triggers the animation as soon as the target enters the root (in this case, the viewport)! We determine visibility by checking if `isIntersecting` is `true`. When it's `false`, it means the target is not visible‚Äîi.e., it's outside the viewport  and not intersecting.

### The Second Knob: The Options Object

The second knob to control what we're interested in is the second argument to the `IntersectionObserver` constructor. It's an object with three optional properties.

```js
const options = {
  root: document.querySelector("#scrollArea"),
  rootMargin: "0px",
  threshold: 1.0,
};
```

We won't cover the `root` option in this blog post. Let's look at the other two.

#### rootMargin and threshold

`rootMargin` and `threshold` adjust the boundaries of the root and the target, respectively, used to calculate the intesection. I've added additional controls to the following interactive demo to show how these two properties work. Play around to see what you discover. üòä

<IntersectionObserverVisualizer
  showConfigurator={true}
  caption={
    <NoMarginParagraph>
      Tweak the root margin and the threshold values before observing to alter
      the edges used in the intersection calculation. Root margin can take
      values for all 4 edges like the normal margin property, I've showed only
      the bottom edge to keep it simple. The threshold can also be set to any
      decimal value between 0 and 1. I have restricted it to keep it simple.
    </NoMarginParagraph>
  }
/>
<Spacer size={32} />

In our previous examples, the default `rootMargin` was `0px` on all sides and the default `threshold` was `0`. Let's consider a different example using the above demo. Set the threshold to `1.0` (leaving the `rootMargin` at `0px`) and start observing. Now if you scroll, we won't see a reaction when the first pixel of the target enters the viewport. Instead, we see a reaction when the last pixel enters the viewport (marked by the solid horizontal line).

As another example, stop observing, set the `rootMargin` to `40px`, `threshold` to `0` and scroll the page to the top. Now start observing and scroll the target into view. The reaction will trigger way before the target enters the viewport. More specifically, the reaction triggers when the first pixel of the target touches the `40px` margin's edge.

In our previous example the target scaled up too early, before it was fully in view. It appears as though the balloon is peeking from below.

What if our goal is to make it obvious that the target is increasing in size? We can achieve this by using the `threshold` option we just learnt. Below is the code for the same.

<SandpackDemo projectSubDir="intersectionObserver/exerciseSolution" />

## Conclusion

I hope this helped you get a hold on how the API works! Head on to [the official docs][1] to dig deeper. The API supports specifying multiple threshold levels, knowing the exact intersection ratio and much more! You can also find a list of use cases for this API at the beginning of the page.

This is the abridged version. You can read the unabridged version [here][6].
